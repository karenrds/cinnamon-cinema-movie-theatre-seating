# Cinnamon Cinemas Movie Theatre Seating Challenge
A program that allocates number of seats based on 'random integer' between 1 and 3.

The Theatre has 15 seats, arranged in 3 rows of 5

Rows are assigned a letter from A to C 

Seats are assigned number from 1 to 5

The seats are allocated from A1 filling the auditorium from left to right, front to back  and a checkpoint the keeps the record of the previous allocated seats.

Once there are not enough seats available to be allocated then the program halts.
